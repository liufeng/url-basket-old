url-basket
==========

This is an application works on Google App Engine.

Sometimes I open too many tabs in my browser and don't have enough
time to read them all. So I keep them in the browser, but that makes
my machine slow. So I'd like a place for saving these URLs
temporarily. A text file is not good enought, because I want to get
the URLs easily in anywhere. So I created this web application.

This application is under the BSD license.
